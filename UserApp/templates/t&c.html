You understand that we may at any time (directly or indirectly) ask for customer referrals on terms that may differ from those contained in this agreement or other web sites that are similar to or compete with your web site.

                                Any dispute related to our program or this agreement in which the aggregate total claim for relief sought on behalf of one or more parties exceeds one lakh rupees will be adjudicated in any state or federal court in Delhi. You will have consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in those courts. You also acknowledge and agree that our rights in the content are of a special, exclusive, extraordinary character, giving them peculiar value, the loss of which cannot be readily compensated for in monetary damages.

You cannot assign this agreement, without our prior written consent, by operation of law or otherwise. Subject to that restriction, this Agreement will be binding on and be enforceable against the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Our failure to impose your strict performance of any provision of this agreement will not lead to a waiver of our right to subsequently impose such provision or any other provision of this agreement.
